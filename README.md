Cargo Theft in the US: Analyzing Trends and Recovery Rates

<b>Overview</b><br/>
This project analyzes cargo theft in the United States using data sourced from the FBIâ€™s official records (last updated in 2024). The analysis focuses on identifying factors that influence the likelihood of stolen items being recovered, the value of recovered goods, and broader trends in cargo theft over time.

<b>Data Notes</b>
The dataset is considered reliable but has certain limitations:

Granular temporal data on stolen items is unavailable.

Recovered item values may be inaccurate, with numerous cases listing a $1 return value, raising questions about usability.

Outliers in stolen values were identified, with some exceeding $100M. To ensure actionable insights, values exceeding one standard deviation from the mean (~$2.3M) were excluded.

<b>Key Questions Explored</b>
- What factors influence whether stolen cargo is recovered?

- How does the value of recovered goods compare to their stolen value?

- What trends contribute to the increasing rate of cargo theft in the U.S.?

This repository includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to support findings.
